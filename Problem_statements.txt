1) Calories_consumed-> predict weight gained using calories consumed
	Answer: I think Sqrt transformation of Y varibale is the best model we can use. Because in this transformation I got the highest r value, R^2 value and lowest RMSE. 

2) Delivery_time -> Predict delivery time using sorting time 
	Answer: Here we could have used the Polynomial Transformation ( 3 degree) for which we have the highest R^2 value and lowest RMSE. But the porbability of making error on using the intercept and coefficient values is more than 0.05.
		So, the better option would be to use the Sqrt Transformation of X variable.

3) Emp_data -> Build a prediction model for Churn_out_rate 
	Answer: Log Transformation of Y variable is a better model because in this transformation we get highest r value, R^2 value and lowest RMSE.

4) Salary_hike -> Build a prediction model for Salary_hike
	Answer: Simple Linear Regression Model is a better model because we get the highest r value, R^2 value and lowest RMSE. 


Do the necessary transformations for input variables for getting better R^2 value for the model prepared.
